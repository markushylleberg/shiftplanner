# Shift Planner
## A React, Node.js, Express.js project that uses Objection.js and Knex.js to use a MySQL database and has a full authentication and login/register system.

With Shift Planner you can easily book and have an overview over your shifts in a bookstore, caf√©, restuarant... - you name it!

### As an admin 
you're able to create new shifts to the database.

### As an user
you're able to book a shift in a 'first come first served' matter. The moment you book a shift it is occupied by you and unavailable for other. This shift will now appear on your users "My shifts".

Shift Planner is to be hosted soon.
